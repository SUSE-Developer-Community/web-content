# DevOps: A Cultural Movement for a New Way of Working 

Background

# What really is DevOps? 

The term derived from the culmination of two words, development and operations, seems fairly intuitive, but what is it really in the modern technological age. DevOps has evolved to be a culture of work that encourages cross-functional collaboration between development and operations teams to accelerate the rate at which enterprises realize value for technical and social changes. It is less about a department or job function, but rather a way of thinking, a philosophical mindset that helps organizations develop and maintain efficient and sustainable practices. 

# The DevOps culture: working more effectively

No collaborative culture has ever been successful in a vacuum, especially when objectives, ways of working and outcomes are so intertwined. The software that companies build, doesn’t exist distinctly from those that create and use it. Prior to modern day DevOps, development and operations teams worked in isolation. DevOps just kind of happened naturally, with so much overlapping between these two groups, over time the IT operator and developer realized they are very much the same. Today, enterprise companies adapted to this and encouraging collaboration of these two groups ultimately accelerates the pace of innovation. 

# Why is DevOps needed

The new way of doing things with DevOps, doesn’t mean let’s throw out everything we have done in the past. It is actually not about a prescription for the only true way of doing things, but encourages numerous ways DevOps principles can be applied throughout the entire organization. DevOps allows teams to implement integration and speeds the delivery of go-to-market products. Some of the main driving reasons DevOps is so important are;

1. Predictability: DevOps offers significantly lower failure rate of new releases
2. Reproducibility: Version everything so that earlier version can be restored anytime.
3. Maintainability: Effortless process of recovery in the event of a new release crashing or disabling the current system.
4. Time to market: DevOps reduces the time to market up to 50% through streamlined software delivery. This is particularly the case for digital and mobile applications.
5. Greater Quality: DevOps helps the team to provide improved quality of application development as it incorporates infrastructure issues.
6. Reduced Risk: DevOps incorporates security aspects in the software delivery lifecycle. It helps in reduction of defects across the lifecycle.
7. Resiliency: The Operational state of the software system is more stable, secure, and changes are auditable.
8. Cost Efficiency: DevOps offers cost efficiency in the software development process which is always an aspiration of IT companies' management.
9. Breaks larger code base into small pieces: DevOps is based on the agile programming method. Therefore, it allows breaking larger code bases into smaller and manageable chunks.

# The foundation of DevOps

At the heart of DevOps, success if found when people come together and work as teams rather than distinct groups with a desire for mutual understanding. With collaboration and clear communication, teams can work more productively towards their shared organizational goals.
